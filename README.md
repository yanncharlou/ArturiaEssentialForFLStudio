# Arturia Keylab Essential for FLStudio

This script is intended to allow using all controls of Arturia Keylab Essential keyboard under FL Studio.
Testing with my own Arturia Essential 61. Should work with other keyboards of this line.

To use it you have to choose the DAW map on your keyboard. (Press Map Select + PAD 2)

Beta version. Simple but working. :-)

Any idea about how to use buttons is welcome. Feel free to 

## Howto

1. Download the script and unzip it. You will get a `ArturiaEssentialForFLStudio` directory.
2. Place this directory into `Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\` (default place. in some case you may have placed this directory elsewhere)
3. In Fl Studio got to MIDI Settings. In input , at the line of `MIDIIN2 (Arturia Keylab Essential)`, set controller type to `Arturia Essential Controller (user)`
4. Set your Arturia Keylab Essential Keyboard to DAW mode by pressing `Map Select` then PAD 2.

Et voil√†. ;-)

Have fun and tell me what function I should add on wich button in next release.
